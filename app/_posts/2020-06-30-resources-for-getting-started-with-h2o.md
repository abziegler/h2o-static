H2O offers a way for you to create high-quality, freely available, online casebooks. How can you get started with H2O? This [video introduction](https://vimeo.com/422850658) is a great place to start!

We’re also sharing resources for creating your first casebook. You can visit our [Help Guide](https://about.opencasebook.org/), which includes sections on [Making Casebooks](https://about.opencasebook.org/making-casebooks/), [Printing Casebooks](https://about.opencasebook.org/printing-casebooks/), and a collection of [video how-tos](https://about.opencasebook.org/other-resources/).

Wondering what an H2O casebook can look like? The [H2O homepage](https://opencasebook.org/) is one place to start with examples from featured authors, from [Contracts](https://opencasebook.org/casebooks/75344/) by Charles Fried to [Criminal Law](https://opencasebook.org/casebooks/28024/) by Jeannie Suk Gersen. You can also view our [directory of free and open legal education resources](https://about.opencasebook.org/casebook-directory/) created in H2O and elsewhere.

We’re excited to help you get started. Have questions or ideas about creating your first casebook? You can reach us at [info@opencasebook.org](mailto:info@opencasebook.org).
