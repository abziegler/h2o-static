Several instructors have utilized H2O's export feature to export their casebooks out of H2O and after some clean-up, load them into a print-on-demand service (such as Amazon CreateSpace) and offer the text as a print book at a fraction of the cost of a traditional casebook. Here, a selection of casebooks created on H2O, now offered as a print text through Amazon:
