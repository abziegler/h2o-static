We’ve had some recent, exciting developments in the world of H2O, building on work already done that allows more than one user to edit casebooks as well as the integration with the [Caselaw Access Project](https://lil.law.harvard.edu/blog/2018/10/29/caselaw-access-project-cap-launches-api-and-bulk-data-service/).

After the recent H2O redesign, the navigation and readability of the site’s content both improved, but one thing that remained at the same pace was the time it took to apply an annotation – elision, highlight, etc – to the text.

After some deep work done by the H2O dev team – this has improved remarkably. As opposed to annotations taking several seconds to apply, including a refresh of the page, annotations now apply immediately. See below:

Massive thanks to Greg and Casey for their hard work on this feature!
