H2O is now sharing the [H2O Casebook Directory](https://about.opencasebook.org/casebook-directory/); a source of free and open resources for legal education. The H2O Casebook Directory is made available as part of [H2O Open Casebooks](https://opencasebook.org/) from Harvard Law School Library.

Open educational resources can change how we study the law and lower costs to students. The H2O Casebook Directory shares open and freely available casebooks and resources from authors including Charles Fried ([Contracts](https://opencasebook.org/casebooks/477-contracts-casebook-digital-version/)), Jeanne C. Fromer and Christopher Jon Sprigman ([Copyright Law: Cases and Materials](http://www.copyrightbook.org/)), and more.
