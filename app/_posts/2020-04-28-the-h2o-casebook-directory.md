H2O is now sharing a [casebook directory](https://about.opencasebook.org/casebook-directory/), a source of free or open resources for legal education. The casebook directory is made available as part of [H2O](https://opencasebook.org/), a project of the Library Innovation Lab at the Harvard Law School Library.

Open educational resources can change how we study the law, and lower costs to students. The H2O casebook directory includes freely available casebooks from Charles Fried ([Contracts](https://opencasebook.org/casebooks/477-contracts-casebook-digital-version/)), Jeanne C. Fromer and Christopher Jon Sprigman ([Copyright Law: Cases and Materials](http://www.copyrightbook.org/)), and more.

Do you have a resource to share? You can [help us expand the directory](https://forms.gle/odXVwPCnu5NxbLA19) with new resources.
