H2O has been around for a while, consistently worked on to make it simpler and more useful for instructors and students. One feature that’s been requested for some time, though, is now finally public: “collaborators” – the ability for multiple users to make changes to the same casebook-syllabus without having to share login info.

WIth collaborators, professors can now request access for specific casebooks be given to their admin staff or teaching/research assistants. Once given access, these collaborators can make changes, update, and make public (‘publish’) these changes on the H2O platform.

To add a user as a collaborator to one of your casebooks, simply shoot us an email – info(@ opencasebook.org – with the email of the user you’d like to add, and the ID # of the casebook you’d like them added to, which can be found in the URL when viewing it.

While we plan to make this self-service in the future, we’re excited about this new feature as it is and how H2O’s growing use will help accelerate the use of OER in legal education.
