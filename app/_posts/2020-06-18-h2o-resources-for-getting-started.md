We’re sharing resources to help you create open casebooks with H2O. 

H2O offers a way for you to create high quality, freely available, online casebooks and more. How can you get started with H2O in your community? We’re creating resources to introduce H2O and what it can offer students and faculty. This [video introduction](https://vimeo.com/422850658) is a great place to start!

We’re also sharing resources for creating your first casebook. You can visit our [Help Guide](https://about.opencasebook.org/) that shares more about [Making Casebooks](https://about.opencasebook.org/making-casebooks/), [Printing Casebooks](https://about.opencasebook.org/printing-casebooks/), and a collection of [video how-tos](https://about.opencasebook.org/other-resources/).

Looking for examples of what an H2O casebook can look like? The [H2O homepage](https://opencasebook.org/) is one place to start with examples from featured authors, from [Contracts](https://opencasebook.org/casebooks/75344/) by Charles Fried to [Criminal Law](https://opencasebook.org/casebooks/28024/) by Jeannie Suk Gersen. You can also view our [directory of free and open legal education resources](https://about.opencasebook.org/casebook-directory/) created with H2O and more.

We’re excited to help you get started. Have questions or ideas about creating your first casebook? You can reach us at [info@opencasebook.org](mailto:info@opencasebook.org).
